        Badarinath or Badarinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to
        Vishnu. It is situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India.
        The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu—holy
        shrines for Vaishnavas—who is worshipped as Badrinath. It is open for
        six months every year (between the end of April and the beginning of
        November), because of extreme weather conditions in the Himalayan
        region. The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district
        along the banks of Alaknanda River. It is one of the most visited
        pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 2.8 million (28 lakh)
        visits in just 2 months in 2022. It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage
        sites.</big>

        Dedicated to the Hindu Sun-god Surya, what remains of the temple complex
        has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels
        and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high,[1][5]
        much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara
        tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the
        mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are
        famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including
        erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a
        classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga
        architecture.</big>

        The Somanath temple (IAST: somanātha) or Deo Patan, is a Hindu temple
        located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India. It is one of the
        most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is the first among the
        twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.[1] It is unclear when the first
        version of the Somnath temple was built, with estimates varying between
        the early centuries of the 1st millennium and about the 9th century
        CE.[2][3] The temple is not mentioned in the ancient Sanskrit texts of
        Hinduism; while various texts, including the Mahabharata and Bhagavata
        Purana, mention a tirtha (pilgrimage site) at Prabhas Patan on the
        coastline of Saurashtra, where the temple is presently located, there is
        no evidence that a temple existed at the site in ancient times.
