        <big>The Alaknanda is a turbulent Himalayan river in the Indian state of
          Uttarakhand and one of the two headstreams of the Ganges, the major
          river of Northern India and a river considered holy in Hinduism. In
          hydrology, the Alaknanda is considered the source stream of the Ganges
          on account of its greater length and discharge;[1] while, in Hindu
          tradition and culture, the other headstream, the Bhagirathi, is
          considered the source stream.</big>

          confluences) of Alaknanda River where Alaknanda meets the Bhagirathi
          river and both rivers thereafter flow on as the Ganges river or
          Ganga.</big >

        <big>The Ganges is a lifeline to tens of millions of people who live in
          its basin and depend on it for their daily needs.[13] It has been
          important historically, with many former provincial or imperial
          capitals such as Pataliputra,[14] Kannauj,[14] Sonargaon, Dhaka,
          Bikrampur, Kara, Munger, Kashi, Patna, Hajipur, Delhi, Bhagalpur,
          Murshidabad, Baharampur, Kampilya, and Kolkata located on its banks or
          the banks of tributaries and connected waterways. The river is home to
          approximately 140 species of fish, 90 species of amphibians, and also
          reptiles and mammals, including critically endangered species such as
          the gharial and South Asian river dolphin.[15] The Ganges is the most
          sacred river to Hindus.[16] It is worshipped as the goddess Ganga in
          Hinduism.</big >
